# JarKz's NixOS configuration

The configuration was copied from [my dotfiles](https://github.com/jarkz/dotfiles) with optimizations that can be doable with Nix.

![Showcase](assets/showcase.png)

Using components:

- **WM**: niri
- **Wallpaper**: SWWW
- **Lock**: hyprlock
- **Idle manager**: hypridle
- **Bar**: Waybar
- **Application Launcher**: wofi
- **Notification Daemon**: noti
- **Terminal**: WezTerm
- **IDE**: NeoVim or JetBrains products

## Installation

### Fox NixOS

1. Make sure that you replace the `hardware-configuration.nix` file with your (it will be generated by NixOS at installation) at `hosts/desktop/hardware-configuration.nix`.
2. Add your `vpn.nix` configuration in `system/` directory. Or remove this entry in `system/default.nix` if you don't want to have VPN.
3. Replace the user `jarkz` with your user name.
4. Run:

```bash
# nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#desktop
```

5. Install [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
6. Run:

```bash
$ home-manager switch --flake .#desktop
```

### For standalone home-manager

1. Make sure that you have installed important applications that listed in `hosts/desktop/configuration.nix` and `system/*.nix`.
2. Install [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager)
3. Run:

```bash
$ home-manager switch --flake .#desktop
```

## Caveats

This configuration was made perfectly for my machine and may not suit your. At this point I list here the potential changes that you can made:

- niri configuration (outputs, language and so on) — `home/configuration/niri`
- theme configuratoin — `home/configuration/theming`
- waybar configuration - `home/configuration/waybar`
